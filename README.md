# RAG-Document-Q-A-With-Groq-And-Llama3
 RAG Document Q&amp;A with Groq and Llama3 is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines the strengths of advanced language models like Llama 3 and Groq to enhance question-answering capabilities on document-based content.

 In this system:

Groq serves as the powerful computing engine to handle the model's execution and scaling.
Llama 3 acts as the generative language model responsible for answering complex queries.
The Q&A system extracts and retrieves precise pieces of information from large datasets using retrieval mechanisms and then augments the responses generated by the Llama 3 model.
